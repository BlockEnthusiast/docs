## How do I get DOUGH?

Minting of new DOUGH takes place when a wallet proposes a purchase price, and existing DOUGH holders vote to approve the offer. When a vote succeeds, a transfer is initiated, sending the offered assets to Pie DAO's vault. Upon receipt, the DAO mints the requested DOUGH into the proposing wallet.

## Can I trade it?

At the moment, DOUGH is locked in the original purchaser's account and cannot be sold or traded. When Staking is released, DOUGH tokens will be unlocked, allowing for free trade on the open market. 

## Can I get my money back?

Pie DAO's vault backs the DOUGH tokens in circulation. If at any point a member wishes to burn their tokens in exchange for the underlying assets, they can do so through a process called a Rage Quit.
