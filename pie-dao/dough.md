## How do I get DOUGH?

Minting of new DOUGH takes place when a wallet pledges ETH to the DAO, and existing DOUGH holders vote to approve the offer. When a vote succeeds, a transfer is initiated, sending the offered assets to Pie DAO's vault. Upon receipt, the DAO mints the requested DOUGH into the proposing wallet.

## Can I trade it?

No. At the moment, DOUGH is locked in the original purchaser's account and cannot be sold or traded. When Staking is released, DOUGH can be migrated to a new free-floating token. 

## Can I get my money back?

Pie DAO's vault backs the DOUGH tokens in circulation. If at any point a member wishes to burn their tokens in exchange for the underlying assets, they can do so through a process called a Rage Quit.
