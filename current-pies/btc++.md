## Description

BTC++ itâ€™s a weighed allocation between the different representations of Bitcoin on the Ethereum.

## Motivation

There is a race for bridging Bitcoin to the Ethereum Network. a number of projects have made steps in that direction with adopting solutions that go from 100% custodian services to mechanism design that might result in economic finality for a trustless swap of BTC&lt;-&gt;ETH.

Each project has different tradeoffs in terms of security, even assuming the assumptions are correct the risk associated with bugs on the system makes holding those tokens risky in isolation.

## Benefits for users

* Users who want to have controlled exposure to different BTC on Ethereum don't have to deal with complicated and/or expensive rebalancing procedures.
* Holders of WBTC/pBTC/imBTC/sBTC.. who have those tokens sitting idly in a wallet can now put them to work so they can effortlessly earn fees.

## Allocation

| Token | Custodian | Initial Allocation |

## Usecase for traders
