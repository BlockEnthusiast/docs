# DEFI++

## Summary

The DeFi++ Index would be defined as a weighted composition of both LargeCaps & SmallCaps indexes, with weights defined as per Governance input in order to factor in the overall market outlook, the risk propensity, etc.

DeFi++ Index would be initially priced at $ 1,000, and trading as a function of both the LargeCaps & SmallCaps indexes.  
The DeFi++ token would be pegged to 1/1000 of the DeFi++ Index.
