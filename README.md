  Welcome to the PieDAO docs. This is a live document that will be updated as
  PieDAO evolves. We aim to provide a detailed view of the various goals,
  software, and products provided through PieDAO.

## What is the Pie Network?

The Pie Network is a set of smart contracts staked together to create asset allocations represented by unique ERC-20 tokens. By democratizing access to best in class asset allocations strategies, removing minimum capital requirements, and massively reduce fees, Pie Protocol allows everyone equal access to the global financial marketplace.

For more about the reasoning behind the creation of PieDAO, check out the Medium article, ['Introducing PieDAO, the asset allocation DAO.'](https://medium.com/piedao/introducing-piedao-the-asset-allocation-dao-1af9eec5ee4)

## What is the PieDAO?

The PieDAO is a decentralized organization dedicated to bringing market accessibility and economic empowerment to anyone with an internet connection through Pie Protocol. Anybody in the public community may support these efforts by completing bounties, making feature requests, or proposing new Pies. DOUGH token holders are the DAO's decision-makers, governing which proposals are accepted.

## What is PieDAO not?

**PieDAO is not an investment advisory or money transfer service of any kind**.

It does not facilitate investment, operate an exchange, create markets, create smart contracts, escrow, custody, transfer, or otherwise handle user-owned funds, provide investment advice, or control in any way who accesses PieDAO services.

**PieDAO does not host or maintain any software or services.**

Hosting of associated software and services is either done on a decentralized network or by individual members of the community who may or may not choose to make their identity known. All software involved in the operation of PieDAO is open source.

**PieDAO does not manage or propose asset allocations.**

Management of asset allocations utilizing the Pie Protocol is done by DOUGH holders and deployed by individual users of the Pie smart contracts, not by any single entity or PieDAO itself.

**PieDAO gives no guarantees.**

Asset allocations, smart contracts, and other related software may not be usable, effective, or promote the market value of the DOUGH token or any Pie asset allocation. We invite you NOT TO PARTICIPATE as you might lose all of your money.

## Potential Use Cases

* **Diversified Stable Coin** - Imagine a USD stablecoin backed by a basket of other USD stablecoins. Why? Diversification. If one of these crashes or suffers a fatal flaw, you won't be left with something worthless.
* **DeFi Basket** - Blend all the hottest DeFi tokens together and stay protected in case one project fails. Go long on DeFi as a whole, not a single project.
* **Crypto Basket** - Top performing crypto assets bundled together, so you can have non-custodial exposure to the whole market.
* **AWP++** - Popularized by Ray Dalio, the All Weather Portfolio is a top performer. Our backtesting shows it performs even better with crypto assets mixed in.
