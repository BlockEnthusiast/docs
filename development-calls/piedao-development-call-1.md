* Interesting potential use cases for flash loans
  * Increase yield for LPs
  * Arbitrage
  * AAVE flash loans are used frequently for liquidating loans
  * Refinancing
  * Currency swaps
* Bounty program
  * POAP tokens may have something to do with trust in bounties

  * How important and of difficult a task is should be indicated
