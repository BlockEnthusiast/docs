## Notes / Highlights

* Travis \(@travisdmathis\) has taken our first bounties
* Flash loan experiments are cool and it looks like we can do it, thanks Mick!
* Only major flash loan challenge is the need to lock trading for the transaction
* Would make sense to be able to turn off flash loans via permission
* Travis's bounty vote: [https://mainnet.aragon.org/\#/piedao/0x109b588a4f2a234e302c722f91fe42c5ab828a32/vote/150/](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/piedao/0x109b588a4f2a234e302c722f91fe42c5ab828a32/vote/150/)
* Bounty program docs: [https://docs.piedao.org/development-resources/development-bounty-program](https://docs.piedao.org/development-resources/development-bounty-program)
* For any freelancer this process should feel familiar per @travisdmathis 
* More detail around the technical implementation/pointers in the stories would help new people onboard
* Timeline!
